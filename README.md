# Image Classifier on CIFAR-10 dataset

This notebook contains a simple implementation of Convolution Neural Networks to build an Image Classifier.
At the end a simple gradio interface is also implemented for a simple UI.

### Try it in your device
- Clone the repo
- Run the cells (execution on GPU is faster if available)
- Tweak the CNN model for better performace
- Try with your own image through the Gradio Interface
